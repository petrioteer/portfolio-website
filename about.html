        Hello There! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Itesh a 20 y/o guy passionate about computers.
        <br>
        <br>
        It all started for me when i was 7 or 8 years old when i first saw a computer, and i was fascinated by it.That day, i fell in love with the technology and
        since then i have never looked back. 
        <br>
        I am a first year Undergraduate Student in Computer Science & Engineering from Lovely Professional University.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am exploring web development, working with various technologies, libraries, and frameworks.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a nutshell, I'm all about breaking down complex tech stuff, building cool things, and having some fun along the way!
